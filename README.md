# Shop Database (shop-database-v1-app)

Brown's Body Shop's job database: reads CCC ONE / Mitchell estimates, saves every job and estimate version, and
grows into the production board, customer communication log and parts receiving (see `docs/data-model.md`).
Originally started as `parts-list-v1`.

## Project Prompt

Auto Body Shop Database System — Project Overview
Business Need

Build a centralized database system for [Shop Name] to manage all job information, documentation, and shop operations. Currently, job data is scattered across estimate PDFs, spreadsheets, and email. This system will become the single source of truth for all shop operations.

Long-Term Vision (Full System)

The completed system will:

Centralize all job data — estimates, labor, parts, status, documents (invoices, communications, photos)
Feed downstream tools that shop staff use daily:
Parts receiving document (updates inventory, links to jobs)
Production/shop board (shows job status in real-time)
Job tracking/archival (completed and archived jobs)
Customer communications and invoicing
Enable data-driven decisions — job profitability, turnaround time, parts costs, etc.
Phase 1: PDF Extraction & Data Display (THIS SPRINT)

Goal: Build a PDF ingestion tool that can reliably extract estimate data and display it in a structured format.

Scope:

Upload estimate PDF from CCC ONE or Mitchell (estimates and supplements)
Extract only what the estimate prints - the parser never calculates or fills in values:
Customer name and contact info
Vehicle info (year, make, model, VIN)
Insurance company, claim #, RO # (CCC prints it; Mitchell's is typed in by hand)
Labor line items (description, operation, labor type, hours) - labor dollars and rates come from the printed labor totals
Parts line items (description, part #, part type, quantity, price as printed)
Other charges and sublet (description, amount as printed)
Estimate totals as printed (labor by type, parts, materials, tax, grand total)
Display extracted data in a clean table format
Validate accuracy: compare what was read against the estimate's own printed totals and flag "Needs review" when they don't match

Deliverable:

Working tool that reliably parses estimate PDFs and displays results
Code is modular so the parser can be reused when building the database later

Success Criteria:

Correctly extracts 90%+ of data from a sample estimate PDF
Handles formatting variations in the estimate document
Easy to iterate on if extraction misses anything
Phase 2 & Beyond (Future)
Create database schema based on extracted data structure
Build REST API for job CRUD operations
Integrate PDF parser into job creation workflow
Add document storage (linking files to jobs)
Build production board and parts receiving tools
Add user permissions and audit logging
Technical Approach
Language: Python (for fast iteration)
PDF parsing: pdfplumber
Display: Flask upload page showing HTML tables (upload a PDF, see the itemized result)
Storage: Git repo, pushing incrementally
Next step: Once parsing is solid, create database schema to match this data structure

## Phase 1 status: built

Supports **CCC ONE** and **Mitchell** estimate/supplement PDFs (all pages read). Each charge is itemized as
Part, Body / Paint / Mechanical (and Structural, Frame...) Labor, Sublet or Other Charge. Every parse is checked against
the estimate's own totals (labor hours by type, parts/charges total, supplement history). If a check fails or the
document type / print time can't be read, the page shows a red "Needs review" box listing why.

## Phase 2 status: core database built

Every uploaded estimate is saved. It is matched to its job by RO #, then claim #, then VIN; a supplement becomes a
new version of the same job and the newest version becomes the job's current estimate. Pages: **Upload estimate**,
**Jobs** (all open jobs) and a job page (RO # editing, estimate versions with their PDFs, change log). Uploading the
same PDF twice keeps one copy.

The database is a SQLite file at `data/shop.db` and the PDFs are kept in `data/files/` - both ignored by git so
customer data stays local. Set `DATABASE_URL` to use PostgreSQL instead, or `SHOP_DATA_DIR` to keep the data
somewhere else.

### Run it

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py        # then open http://127.0.0.1:5000 and upload a PDF
```

Put test PDFs in `samples/` (ignored by git so customer data stays local).

### Layout

- `estimate_parser/ccc.py`, `mitchell.py` - one parser per format (header, line items, totals)
- `estimate_parser/core.py` - format detection, `parse_pdf()`, validation checks
- `estimate_parser/render.py` - HTML pages
- `db/models.py` - database tables; `db/save.py` - `save_parse()` and change logging; `db/session.py` - connection
- `app.py` - the web app
- `docs/data-model.md` - database design for the web app (jobs, estimates, production board, customer
  communication, parts receiving) and the order to build it in
